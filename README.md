# MacOS_Floweys-Time-Machine
"Flowey's Time Machine for MacOS" will be a program for MacOS to change UNDERTALE's rooms, items, fun and much more without changing the files yourself. I chose the name for this project because there is already a popular website, that generates files for your game, wich you can move into the appropriate game folder (https://crumblingstatue.github.io/FloweysTimeMachine"). This program although, edits the files directly, without you having to care about them. Have in mind that it WILL BE a tool with many things to change. Currently it only has a few features.
